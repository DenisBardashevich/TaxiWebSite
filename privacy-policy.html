                        At Permaglam, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to our

                    <p>
                        We have adopted appropriate practices for collecting, storing, and processing data, as well as
                        security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of
                        your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our
                        website.

                    <p>
                        Your personal information is stored on secure servers and protected by firewalls and advanced
                        encryption to ensure maximum security. However, it is important to remember that no data
                        transmission over the Internet or electronic storage method is 100% secure. Therefore, while we
                        strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                        You are also responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your login information and password.
                        We recommend choosing strong and unique passwords and not sharing your access credentials with
                        anyone.

                        activity in your account, please contact us immediately so that we can take necessary measures to
                        protect your privacy and security.
